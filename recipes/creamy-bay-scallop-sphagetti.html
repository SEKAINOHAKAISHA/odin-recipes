        <h2>Description</h2>
        This scallop pasta dinner with a creamy sauce is fast and easy. 
        I cook the scallops a bit longer than many chefs, but that gives the dish more flavor and they're still tender and moist. 
        I think you'll agree, the sherry sauce benefits significantly from the longer cook time.

    </p>
    <h2>Steps to make</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 
                about 10 minutes or 1 minute less than directed on the package.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. 
                When oil just starts to smoke, add scallops and move them into a single layer. 
                Let sear on high for about 1 minute. Toss to turn.</li>
            <li>Add butter and stir scallops until butter melts. Stir in garlic.</li>
            <li>Add lemon zest and red pepper flakes. Stir in sherry and cook and stir until alcohol cooks off, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Pour in cream. When mixture begins to simmer, reduce heat to medium-low. Add salt, pepper, and lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta. Transfer to skillet with scallops; bring to a simmer. 
                Add 1/2 of the chopped parsley. Cook until pasta is heated through and tender, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat. Garnish generously with grated cheese. Add the rest of the parsley. Serve in warm bowls.</li>
        </ol>
